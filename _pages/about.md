## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### CHDP: Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies for RL in Parameterized Action Space
* **Contribution:** Proposed and implemented the CHDP framework, which models the hybrid action space problem (involving discrete and corresponding continuous actions) as a multi-agent cooperative game.
    * Developed a Dual Diffusion policy to effectively capture multimodal action distributions.
    * Leveraged a novel Q-value-guided codebook to significantly enhance the scalability of the action space.
* **Publication Status:** Submitted to **AAAI 2026** (CCF-A Conference), rating 7,7,7,6.5. Second author (supervisor as the first author).

### Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for ICVs in CFNs via Constrained MARL

## FUTURE RESEARCH INTERESTS

1.  **Cooperative Generative Policies for Hybrid-Action Manipulation:** Apply and extend the core principles of my AAAI (CHDP) Reinforcement Learning framework to the domain of contact-rich robotic manipulation. Investigating cooperative methods coupled with generative policies (Diffusion, Flow-based Models) to master the complex hybrid action space. This space includes discrete components like contact points and primitive actions (e.g., grasp, push), and continuous parameters like end-effector pose.
2.  **Scalable Multi-modal Action Representations:** Investigate fine-grained manipulation tasks involving large-scale discrete action spaces (e.g., numerous potential contact points). I will adapt the Q-value-guided codebook from my CHDP framework, leveraging its proven scalability to overcome the combinatorial explosion and enable more precise manipulation.
